# network-keys
A script that allows the user to choose from a list of Wi-Fi networks they've connected to and print their passwords.<br/><br/>

<h2>Compatibility and Limitations</h2>

* Windows is currently the only supported OS, as the script relies on Windows-specific commands.
* The script is only able to retrieve passwords for networks that the host has previously connected to.
