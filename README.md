# network-keys
A script that allows the user to choose from a list of Wi-Fi networks they've connected to and print their passwords.<br/><br/>

<h2>Compatibility and Limitations</h2>

* The script is only able to retrieve passwords for networks that the host has previously connected to.
* The script currently relies on commands native to both Windows and Linux. As a result, it must be executed in Windows using an environment that supports 
bash commands, such as Cygwin or Git for Windows.
